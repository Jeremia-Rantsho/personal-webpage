            When talking about Istanbul, we talking about a huge city in Turkey and it is rich in historic places. 
            The city forms part of two continents making it simpler for intra-continent travelling with a ferry. 
            Both continents are divided by a Bosphorus Strait that joins the Black sea. The city itself is 
            considered to be the country's economic, cultural and historic capital. It holds great significant 
            history of Constantinople, Ottoman empire and religiouos places, for instance, Hagia Sophia. 
            The city is beautiful and people are just great. The transportation is affordable and 
            I got to experience beautiful sight-seeing. The reason I chose the city is because I went to 
            the city for my studies. And I want to visit the place for vacation to meet the great people I have met.
