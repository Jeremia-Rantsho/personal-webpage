        What language would to prefer?...
    </h1>

    <p class="langInsight">
        In the world, there are multiple languages and it is basically based on an individual to 
        select their language of choice to learn for a particular reasoning of their own. 
        Learning a language is a good thing afterall because people enable themselves to 
        communicate with different people with different languages making it more easier to 
        survive in areas where one's home language or english may not be known by majority of the people. 
        Well, long story short, in this personal webpage I intended to tell the world about 
        the language of interest for me. The language is Swahili, the language is the most 
        spoken in Africa and as for someone who also want to travel around mother-continent. 
        I want to do it having Swahili language in the bag. As much as we can communicate with 
        each other in English, personally I would like to have a conversation with fellow brothers 
        of the continent in African language.
